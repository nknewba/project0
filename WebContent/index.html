 The beginning.
 
 July 2, Portugal, I finally started learning for real a new language after 10 years as abap developer I think it's time to learn something new
 I don't know if if will use it some day, but I know for sure it will be great.
 To be honest I'm a little bit scared I have already studied a bit about web programming but nothing too deep, and the concepts from what I do
 are totally different, but i'm really excited. I don't know if someone will read this but now it's almost 3 AM I have to wake in 4 hours but i'm really 
 enjoying it. if you're reading this please click in the orange (I hope you're reading and you're going to click ) because now i will have to learn
 how to create a database and save this click somewhere...LOL.
 
 
 This is how it looked like in day one !!!
